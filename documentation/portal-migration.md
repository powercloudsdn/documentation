title: Portal Migration and RouterOS version 7
description: We've rebuilt our provision API's and we're rebuilding our frontend
---

## Headlines

1. The new portal supports RouterOS version 7.5 (stable) and 6.47.10 (long term)
2. We are rebuilding the portal entirely, replacing problematic code and simplifying the design pattern. Unfortunately this means that for a few weeks, some features won't yet exist on the new portal.
3. We will be adding features weekly
4. Sites added to the old portal will not be visible in the new portal and vice versa.
5. Once we have added most of the features to the new portal we will migrate and move your sites.
6. Your login credentials are the same for both the old and new portal
