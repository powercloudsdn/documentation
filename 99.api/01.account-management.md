| Field         | Type    | Description                                                                              |

Here's an example of a valid request payload:

  "email": "john@acme.com",
  "country": "ZA",
  "password": "SDf345FCe",
  "password_confirmation": "SDf345FCe",
  "newsletter": false,
  "reseller_id": ""
}
```

## Response

Upon successful registration, the API will return a response with a `201` status code and a JSON body that includes a `message` field with the following message:

```json
{
  "message": "Registration was successful, please verify your email address"
}
```

This message informs the user that their registration was successful and they need to verify their email address before they can complete the registration process.

If there was an error during registration, the API will return an error with a `4xx` or `5xx` status code, depending on the type of error that occurred.

## Verification Email

After registration, the user will receive an email with a verification link that they need to click to complete the registration process.

The email will come from `MikroCloud <no-reply@mikrocloud.com>` and will have the subject `Verify your email address`.

If the user doesn't receive the email, they should check their spam folder or contact the MikroCloud support team for assistance.

## Conclusion

That's how you can use the MikroCloud API to register for an account. If you encounter any issues during the registration process, feel free to contact the MikroCloud support team for assistance.
