title: Bootstrapping Your MikroTik Router
description: This guide will walk you through the process of bootstrapping your MikroTik router with MikroCloud, which enables you to access a variety of powerful features and services.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that your router meets the following requirements:

* The router must have an internet connection and be able to reach `api.mikrocloud.com` on port `443`.
* It must be running a supported version of RouterOS (MikroCloud focuses on specific long-term versions for improved reliability).

## Steps to Bootstrap Your Router

1. If you have a new router that has never been used, it is recommended to remove the default MikroTik configuration. To do this, log in to the router using Winbox and navigate to the Terminal. Enter the following command:

::rsc

```
/system reset-configuration skip-backup=yes no-defaults=yes
```

#copyable

```
/system reset-configuration skip-backup=yes no-defaults=yes
```

::

2. Log in to your MikroTik router using Winbox. If you don't already have Winbox, you can download it from the [MikroTik website](https://mikrotik.com/download).

3. Once logged in, navigate to the Terminal by clicking on "New Terminal" in the lower-left corner of the Winbox interface.

4. In the Terminal, issue the following command:

::rsc

```
/tool fetch url="https://api.mikrocloud.com/bootstrap" dst-path="mikrocloud.rsc";
/import mikrocloud.rsc;
```

#copyable

```
/tool fetch url="https://api.mikrocloud.com/bootstrap" dst-path="mikrocloud.rsc";/import mikrocloud.rsc;
```

::

This command downloads the bootstrap script and executes it. After completion, an 8-character activation code (e.g., `xxxx-xxxx`) will be displayed.

5. Visit the MikroCloud portal at [https://app.mikrocloud.com/new](https://app.mikrocloud.com/new) and log in.

6. Enter the 8-character activation code displayed in the Terminal.

7. Provide a name for your site and assign an address. The address is required because it determines the AWS infrastructure used for an optimal experience. Note that activation will not be possible if the provided address is outside of the country where the router's connection originates from.

8. After entering the required information, your site will be linked to your MikroCloud account, and the bootstrapping process is complete.

## Changes Made to the Router

Upon bootstrapping, the following changes will be made to your MikroTik router:

* A scheduler will be added, allowing MikroCloud to manage the device.
* A management VPN tunnel will be created.
* A MikroCloud API user will be added, enabling API login.

You can track these changes by viewing the Orchestration log in the MikroCloud portal when accessing your site.

# Note on Missed Heartbeat Graph
Please note that the missed heartbeat graph on the site overview page will take about 24 hours before it displays any data.

By following these steps, you can easily bootstrap your MikroTik router and take advantage of the powerful features offered by MikroCloud.
