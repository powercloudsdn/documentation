## Our Ability to Execute

### Product/Service
At the core of our existence is a product that we design, implement and improve ourselves on an ongoing basis. We have a narrow focus in a diverse industry and we strive to deliver a product for MikroTik devices that outperforms that of our competitors on every possible evaluation metric.

### Overall Viability
We consider our viability to consist of the overall business' financial health, the financial and practical success of our product and the likelihood that will be able to continue investing in our product, will continue offering our product and will advance the state of our product when brought into a comparative light with other vendors.

### Market Responsiveness
Key to our long term survival is the ability to respond, change direction, be flexible and achieve competitive success as opportunities develop, competitors act, customer needs evolve and market dynamics change.

### Marketing Execution
We ensure clarity, quality, creativity and efficacy of programs designed to deliver our message to influence the market, promote our brand and business, increase awareness of our product, and establish a positive identification with the product in the minds of buyers. This "mind share" is driven by a combination of publicity, promotional initiatives, thought leadership, word of mouth and sales activities.

### Customer Experience
Relationships matter to us, we self evaluate on an ongoing basis to ensure we live up to a standard that we are proud of. Specifically, this includes the ways our customers receive technical support or account support. This also includes ancillary tools, customer support programs (and the quality thereof), availability of documentation, service-level agreements and so on.

### Operations
We constantly evaluate our ability to meet our goals and commitments. Factors include the quality of the organizational structure, including skills, experiences, programs, systems and other vehicles that enable our organization to operate effectively and efficiently on an ongoing basis.
