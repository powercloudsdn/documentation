title: PowerCloud becomes MikroCloud
description: We are changing a few things so that our name better reflects our mission
---

## In a nutshell

Over the past 12 months we have been doing a lot of work to build up traction in Europe and South America. We started talking to some people at ComCast with the aim of acquiring the domain name powercloud.com, unfortunately the commercials did not make sense to us and to further complicate matters we wouldn't have been able to trademark PowerCloud. 

We then set out to find a new name for our platform, a name that reflects our purpose, a name that is not yet copyrighted or trademarked, and of course a name that has a domain that is still available.

We decided that it will be MikroCloud, the domain was registered already unfortunately, but we were successful in buying it from its owners a few days ago.

## What does this mean?

1. Our name is changing from PowerCloud to MikroCloud
2. We have a new logo
3. Our domain will change to mikrocloud.com
4. We have a fresh new look for our website

## New portal

In order to get rid of a lot of legacy issues with our portal we decided to build a new portal that is fully integrated with our 3rd generation API's. 

There will a period of time where we run both web apps at the same time, but in time the new portal will completely replace the functionality of the old portal.

## Multilingual support

Building a new portal means that we can include multi-language support from the start. Our immediate road map will include the following languages:

#### Immediate
1. English

#### 2023
2. Spanish
3. Portuguese
